SARS E-filing is a extremely frustrating process. So buckle up, take a couple hundred panados and lets do this.

I am assuming you've already registered for E-filing, if you haven't this guide won't work for you.

[[How to register guide]]

STEPS:
- log in to e-filing
- at the top of the navbar click on [Returns]
- SARS should have generated an auto assessment and it should be in the table titled **Personal Income Tax (ITR12)**
- If they haven't you'll need to request one
- On the left menu, click on **Returns Issued -> Personal Income Tax (ITR12)**
- There will be a dropdown field on the right side, select the year you're filing for (E.G 2024) then click **Request Return**.
- You should now be redirected to **Income tax work page**
- Recommended: click **Refresh data** and select the options that are relevant to you. (usually IRP5, Medical data, Retirement Annuity data, Investment income and Tax Free investment are relevant)
- Click into your tax return (click **My Tax Return (ITR12)**)
- Use your various tax certificate information to complete the form.
- Usually most of the information would have been preloaded by your employer/medical aid/investment manager
